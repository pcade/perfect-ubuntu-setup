In this article, I’ll share my experience tailoring Ubuntu to fit my workflow. These tweaks might save you time and spare you from unnecessary trial and error. All examples were tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, though many ideas apply to other versions too.

Many colleagues were surprised to learn about the free Ubuntu Pro subscription. Here’s why it’s worth considering:

- Critical component protection: Mitigation for vulnerabilities in core packages.
