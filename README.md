# My ideal Ubuntu: customizing the system to suit my needs.

Customizing Ubuntu for Personal Tasks ‚Äî Crafting Your Own Comfort Zone
In this article, I‚Äôll share my experience tailoring Ubuntu to fit my workflow. These tweaks might save you time and spare you from unnecessary trial and error. All examples were tested on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS, though many ideas apply to other versions too.

## Ubuntu Pro ‚Äî Why Not?

Many colleagues were surprised to learn about the free Ubuntu Pro subscription. Here‚Äôs why it‚Äôs worth considering:

- Extended support: LTS versions receive updates for 10 years instead of 5.
- Enhanced security: Expanded security patches for repositories.
- Critical component protection: Mitigation for vulnerabilities in core packages.

#### How to Activate Ubuntu Pro

1. Visit the [subscription page](https://ubuntu.com/pro).

## Drivers ‚Äî Ubuntu Handles It All
- One of Ubuntu‚Äôs strengths is automatic driver management. After installation, run:
    ```bash
    sudo ubuntu-drivers autoinstall
    ```
- Ubuntu will then notify you of driver updates and install them automatically at startup.

## GNOME Extensions ‚Äî Bring Your Desktop to Life

Out of the box, GNOME feels bland. But with [extensions.gnome.org](extensions.gnome.org), it becomes a canvas for creativity. Here‚Äôs my setup:

</p>

#### Required Packages

- Install these to manage GNOME extensions:
  ```bash
  sudo apt install chrome-gnome-shell gnome-tweaks
  ```
- Visit [extensions.gnome.org](extensions.gnome.org) in your browser.
- Enable the browser extension for GNOME integration.

## Desktop Customization

- Open GNOME Tweaks.
- <details>
    <summary><b>üîç Navigate to Appearance: ‚ñº</b></summary>

- All user themes are stored in /usr/share/themes/, and icons are stored in /usr/share/icons/ and other corresponding directories. All installed themes and icons will be automatically displayed in GNOME Tweaks.

## Zsh + Aliases + SSH Config ‚Äî Supercharge Your Terminal

#### Install Zsh and Oh My Zsh

```bash
sudo apt install zsh  
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```
#### Set Zsh as default
```bash
chsh -s $(which zsh)
```
#### Aliases for Efficiency
- An alias is a convenient shortcut for frequently used commands that helps speed up work in the terminal. To set up an alias in Zsh, open the configuration file ~/.zshrc and ~/.bashrc in Bash, respectively. Below is my example of alias configuration that may be useful:
